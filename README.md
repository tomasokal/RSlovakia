# RSlovakia

This is work in progress to download a set of shapefiles relevant to
Slovakia. It was inspired by the popular
[RCzechia](https://github.com/jlacko/RCzechia) package for Czech
Republic datasets which was in turn inspired by the
[tigris](https://github.com/walkerke/tigris) package.

## The following spatial objects are planned to be included:

  - Borders of Slovakia
  - Regions of Slovakia
  - Districts of Slovakia
  - Municipalities of Slovakia
  - City parts of cities with defined parts in Slovakia
  - Waterways of Slovakia
  - Roads of Slovakia
  - Railroads of Slovakia
  - Protected natural areas of Slovakia
  - Forests of Slovakia
  - Terrain of Slovakia
